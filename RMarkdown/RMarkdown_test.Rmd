## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### One can also use syntax to modify the text
#### This is going to be a ~~great~~ Document.
Here are some few basic Syntax commands to easily structure your markdown document:
- There is the asterisk, which can be used to create
  - **\*\*bold text\*\*** or
  - *\*italicized text\** or even
  - ***\*\*\*both!\*\*\****
- One can also add a blockquote

    > \> Blockquote

- Or even code

        for joke in this:
          print(repr(joke) + " not funny.")

- Oh and we can also highlight code in text so we see that `joke` was a variable.

Thank you for reading. :heart:


##  Python test
```{python}
x = [1,2,3,4]
for i in x:
  print(i)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
